# ny-taxi-data-workspace + Docker
Just a workspace where I will work on some data crunching with dockerized Jupyter notebooks.

## HOWTO In 5-minutes

Start it by running this command from root of project folder `docker-compose up`  or  `docker-compose up -d`

Once started, the former command (Docker console output) will tell you the approximate URL you need to login to the Jupyter notebook instance.

Something like this:  `http://localhost:10000/?token=<<unique-id>>`

Once inside, open one of the Notebooks and run one step at a time.

At the end of 2 of the notebooks is a graphing functionn to plot data on a graph.
